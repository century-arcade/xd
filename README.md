# .xd futureproof crossword format

.xd is a corpus-oriented format, modeled after the simplicity and intuitiveness of the markdown format.  It supports 99.99% of published crosswords, and is intended to be convenient for bulk analysis of crosswords by both humans and machines, from the present and into the future.

## xdfile.py

  * `xdfile.py` has a simple parser for .xd files with example code that
answers some simple queries, like "what is the most used grid in this .zip of .xd files?"

  * `puz2xd.py` will convert Across-Lite .puz format to .xd.  Scripts to convert other formats are also in `src/`.

## Full Example

This is the oldest rebus crossword from the New York Times (found by `grep -r Rebus crosswords/nytimes | sort`), available thanks to the huge effort of the [Pre-Shortzian Puzzle Project](http://www.preshortzianpuzzleproject.com/):

## Format specification

The .xd format is a simple UTF-8 text file, and can often be 7-bit ASCII clean.

Sections are delineated by two or more blank lines (3 consecutive newlines
(0x0A)).  Subsections are delineated by a single blank line.

### Headers (Section 1)

The first section is a set of key:value pairs, one per line.  Standard metadata
descriptors from the [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/) are
preferred.

Multiple entries with the same key are allowed.

Additional subsections indicate lesser exposed metadata.  The first level is Public, the
second level is Machine, the third level is Internal.

### Grid (Section 2)

Optional leading whitespace and trailing whitespace on each line.  Never any
whitespace between characters in a grid line.

One line per row.  One UTF-8 character per cell.

Uppercase A-Z refer to that letter in the solution; a '#' is a block.  In a few
puzzles, '\_' means a space or non-existing block (on the edges), and '.' would
be used for an empty cell (e.g. a partial solution).

Lowercase a-z indicate Special cells. The 'Special' header indicates whether
those cells are "shaded" or have a "circle".

    Special: shaded

Digits, most symbols, and printable unicode characters (if needed) can be used
to indicate rebus cells.  The 'Rebus' header provides the translation:

    Rebus: 1=ONE 2=TWO 3=THREE

Lowercase letters always indicate Special cells if there is a Special header.
If a puzzle has cells that are both Special and Rebus, a lowercase letter
should be used, and set to its value in the Rebus header.

### Clues (Section 3)

A leading uppercase letter indicates the group the clue is in. 'A' or 'D'
indicate Across or Down; the full heading for other letters would be specified
in the 'Cluegroup' header.  For uniclues, the cluegroup letter is omitted.

The clues should be sorted, with a single newline separating clue groups (Across and Down).

Minimal markup is available.  An example clue line:

    A51. {/Italic/}, {*bold*}, {_underscore_}, or {-strike-thru-} ~ MARKUP

The clue is separated from the answer by a tilde with spaces on both sides (' ~ ').

The full answer should be provided, including rebus expansion.

The backslash ('\\') is used as a line separator in the rare case of a multi-line clue.

### Notes (Section 4)

The free-format final section can contain any amount of notes.
