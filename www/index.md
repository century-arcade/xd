# xd

The xd crossword corpus started as a model "small data" project, testing my thesis that simple file formats and obsessive curation are [unreasonably effective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences) in the data sciences.

Since the project did uncover some [malfeasance in the crossword industry](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/gaming/2016/03/how_to_spot_a_plagiarized_crossword.html), it seems important to have an ongoing process for analyzing crosswords, to discourage copytheft and programmatic puzzle generation.

The xd [design](/doc) is intentionally textpunk and therefore platform-agnostic. Anyone can browse, contribute, or consume data with minimal effort.

## Browse

- a [map of all crosswords](/pub) in the corpus
- the [most popular clues](/pub/clue)
- the [most popular words](/pub/word) (answers)
- [/pub/usa2016-03-05](/pub/usa2016-03-05) a specific puzzle, in this case from USAToday on the Saturday that [#gridgate](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gridgate) blew up

## Download

- [xd-tsv.zip](/pub/xd-tsv.zip[xd-tsv.zip): all xd metadata in [.tsv format](/doc/format#tsv)
- [xd-public.zip](/pub/xd-public.zip): all publicly released puzzles in [.xd format](/doc/format#xd)

## Contribute

Submit crosswords for analysis or inclusion to submit@xd.saul.pw (as attachments: .puz, .ipuz, .xd, .pdf, or .zip of these). [More Info](/submit)

The basic collection/analysis/presentation pipeline is operational.  This pipeline needs to be thoroughly documented.

xd needs a legal entity (for the content) and a succession plan.
